From mechanical design, circuit design to programming, my team constructed 3 fully autonomous robots to play hockey in Penn robockey cup 2016.  
I conducted Microcontroller to read ADC from puck sensors and apply PID control on motors’ duty cycle to generate puck finding.  
Also I utilized mWii IR tracker module and necessary code to distinguish 4 infrared stars in a trapezium pattern above the rink.  
Based on this, I applied Inverse Homogeneous Transformation to achieve self-location and further approach-goal.  
In addition, I used mRF wireless module to receive and transmit command among game controller, teammate robots, testing microcontroller for game flow, team strategy and debug.
